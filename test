First: 
Select d.name as department_name, ROUND(AVG(e.age),2) as avg_age
from employees e left join departments d on e.department_id = d.id 
GROUP BY d.name

Output:

+-----------------+---------+
| department_name | avg_age |
+-----------------+---------+
| HR              |   38.40 |
| Finance         |   41.45 |
| Marketing       |   41.40 |
| Operations      |   38.55 |
| IT              |   37.55 |
+-----------------+---------+


Second: 
WITH CTE AS(
  SELECT d.name, count(*) as emp_cnt
  FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d 
  ON e.department_id = d.id
  WHERE e.age > 40
  GROUP BY department_id
)

SELECT name as DepartmentName FROM CTE WHERE emp_cnt = (SELECT MAX(emp_cnt) from CTE)

Output:

+----------------+---------+
| DepartmentName | emp_cnt |
+----------------+---------+
| Operations     |     101 |
+----------------+---------+

Third: 
SELECT COUNT(*) from employees 
where joining_date <= current_date and joining_date >= DATE_SUB(current_date, interval 100 DAY)

Output:

+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|      100 |
+----------+

Fourth: 
UPDATE employees
SET joining_date = current_date - 1 
where department_id = 2

Fifth: 
WITH CTE AS(
  SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN department_id = 2 THEN DATE_SUB(current_date, interval 1 DAY)
    ELSE joining_date 
  END AS date 
  FROM employees
)

SELECT count(*) from CTE 
where date <= current_date and date >= DATE_SUB(current_date, interval 100 DAY)

Output: 
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|      280 |
+----------+
